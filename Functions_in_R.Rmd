## What are functions?

#### Code written to carry out specific task

Functions used to:

- incorporate sets of instructions that we want to use repeatedly
- contain complex code in a neat sub-program
- reduce opportunity for errors
- make code more readable

usually:

- accepts parameters (arguments) <- `INPUT`
- returns value(s) <- `OUTPUT`

<br>

## functions in R

### R is a functional programming language! 
#### provides many tools for the creation and manipulation of functions.

> “To understand computations in R, two slogans are helpful:
>
> - Everything that exists is an object.
> - Everything that happens is a function call."
> 
> John Chambers

even `+` and indexing through `[ ]`!
```{r}
`+`(3,4)
`[`(1:10, 1)

```

<br>

**You can do anything with functions that you can do with vectors:**

- assign them to variables 
- store them in lists
- pass them as arguments to other functions 
- create them inside functions
- return them as the result of a function

## **function basics**

**Basic structure**
```{r, eval=FALSE}
function(arglist){body}
```
*TIP: in Rstudio, typing the `fun` snippet inserts an R function definition:*
```{r}
name <- function(variables) {
    
}
```
Just try typing `fun` 

<br>
<br>

## example function

Let's write a function that will calculate the standard deviation of the values in a vector x.
```{r}
std.dev <- function(x){
    n <- length(x)
    xbar <- sum(x)/n
    diff <- x - xbar
    sum.sq <- sum(diff^2)
    var <- sum.sq / (n-1)
    sqrt(var)
}

```


## function environment

- every time a function is called, a new environment is created to host execution.
- each invocation is completely independent of previous ones
- variables used within are ***local***, e.g. their scope lies within - and is limited to - the function itself. They are therefore **invisible outside the function body**
```{r, error=TRUE}

s.d <- std.dev(1:10)
s.d
xbar

```

## elements of a function

### function name

This can be any valid variable name, but you should avoid using names that are used elsewhere in R, such as `dir`, `function`, `plot`, etc

- choose descriptive names
- use verbs
- check whether they are already in use: `? function.name`

(you can access a function from a specific package using `package.name::function.name`)

<br>

### arguments

Functions can have **any number of arguments**. These can be **any R object:** numbers, strings, arrays, data frames, of even pointers to other functions; anything that is needed for the function.name function to run.
```{r} 
formals(std.dev)
```

<br>

The **`...`**, or **ellipsis**, element in the definition of a function allows for other arguments to be passed into the function, and passed onto to another function. 

```{r}
ellipsis_example <- function(x, ...) {
    input_list <- list(...)
    output_list <- lapply(X=input_list, summary)
    return(output_list)
}
ellipsis_example(x = 1, a=1:10,b=11:20,c=21:30)
```

<br>
<br>

### body

The function code between the `{}` brackets is run every time the function is called. Ideally functions are short and do just one thing. 
```{r} 
body(std.dev)
```

<br>
<br>

### return value

The last line of the code is the value that will be returned by the function. It is not necessary that a function return anything, for example a function that makes a plot might not return anything, whereas a function that does a mathematical operation might return a number, or a list.

***
<br>
<br>

## **arguments & environment**

All arguments required for computation must be supplied.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
rm(list=ls())
```
missing arguments not required for computation are fine:
```{r, error=TRUE}
f1 <- function(a, b, c){a + b}
f1(a = 10 , b = 20)
```
objects required by function will be sought first in the ***local environment***. If an argument specified in the function is missing, it will return an error, even if such an object exists in the global environment.
```{r, error=TRUE}
b <- 10
f1 <- function(a, b){a + b}
f1(a = 10)
f1(a = 10 , b = 20)
```

Objects required by computation but not specified as function arguments will be sought in the containing environment iteratively until it reaches the ***global environment***.

```{r, error=TRUE}
b <- 10
f2 <- function(a){a + b}
f2(a = 10)
rm(b) # remove object b
f2(a = 10)
```

<br>

### **default values**
Default values for arguments can also be supplied when writing the functions
```{r, error=TRUE}
f3 <- function(a, b = 20){a + b}
f3(a = 10)
f3(a = 10, b = 10)
```
- can be a bit dangerous depending on objects from outside the function environment.
- consider using `...`

<br>
<br>

## **outputs**

A function by default returns the last 'thing' evaluated
```{r}
f4 <- function(x){x + 10}
f4(10) # returns a value

f5 <- function(x){
    y <- x + 10}
f5(10) # return an object which needs to be assigned
z <- f5(10)
z

f6 <- function(x){
    y <- x + 10
    return(y)} 
f6(10) # returns a value
v <- f6(10)
v
```

I generally advise you always use `return()` to specify the outputs of your functions. 

You can also use it conditionally to return different values or hault evaluation and return back to the calling environment:
```{r}
f7 <- function(x) {
    y <- x - 10
    if(y < 0){return(NA)}else{
        y <- 2 * y
        return(y)}
}

f7(20)
f7(5)
```

<br>

### **multiple outputs**

If you want to **return multiple values/objects**, you can collect objects created within a function in a **list**. Let's say instead of just the std.dev, we also wanted the mean (`xbar`) and `n` returned. No problem. Just collect them in a list.
```{r}
std.dev <- function(x){
    n <- length(x)
    xbar <- sum(x)/n
    diff <- x - xbar
    sum.sq <- sum(diff^2)
    var <- sum.sq / (n-1)
    s.d <- sqrt(var)
    
    return(list(s.d, xbar, n))
}

std.dev(1:10)

```
- Lists can collect diverse and complex outputs.
- This is basically what outputs of function like `lm` are, a list.

## Calling a function given a list of arguments

Suppose you had a list of function arguments:

```{r}
args <- list(c(1:10, NA), na.rm = TRUE)
```
You could you then send that list to `mean()` by using `do.call()`:

```{r}
do.call(mean, list(1:10, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## **function pipes**

If you have a long workflow of computations:

- break it up into logical blocks 
- write function for each
- write functions so that output from one is the first argument to the next
- use package `dplyr` and the **pipe** shorthand `%>%` to set up **function pipeline**
```{r, eval=F}
install.packages("dplyr")
```

Say I want to prepare a vector of values by removing NAs, scaling and centering the values. First I create a list containg the vector of values as well as an element to track the status of the process.
```{r}
require(dplyr)
l <- list(x = c(1:10, NA), status = NULL)
```

Then I write three functions that will receive and return the list.
```{r}
rmNAs <- function(X){
    X$x <- na.omit(X$x)
    X$status <- c(X$status, "NAs_removed")
    return(X)
}
         
scaleVector <- function(X){
    X$x <- scale(X$x, scale = T)
    X$status <- c(X$status, "scaled")
    return(X)
}          
          
centerVector <- function(X){
    X$x <- scale(X$x, center = T)
    X$status <- c(X$status, "centered")
    return(X)
}  

```

Then I set up a pipeline with the functions and pass the vector through:
```{r}

l %>% rmNAs() %>% scaleVector %>% centerVector

```

## **anonymous functions**

If you just want to use a function once, you don't have to name it:
```{r}
(function(x) x * 10)(10)
```
Anonymous functions can be particularly useful in conjunction with vectorising functions like `lapply()`. Here's an unammed function for calculating the mean of a vector `x`. In the following example, the input `x` to the function is each element of the list `l`.
```{r}
l <- list(1:5, 5:7)
lapply(l, FUN = function(x){sum(x)/length(x)})
```

***

<br>
<br>

## **sourcing functions**

I often write functions associated with a particular project.

I will save all the functions in a separate `"project.name_functions.R"` script. I'll then call that script to make all the functions available to my workflow.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
source("project.name_functions.R")
```
Remember to document details of your functions!

<br>
<br>

## **Avoiding errors**

Let's start with another example of a function:
```{r}
getY <- function(X.matrix, b.vec, a.scalar) {

    # multiply the matrix by the vector using %*% operator
    Xb.prod <- X.matrix %*% b.vec

    # multiply the two resulting objects together to get a final object
    y <- Xb.prod * a.scalar

    # return the result
    return(y)
}
```
Clearly this function requires that the length of the vector and the number of columns in the matrix match.

Let's make some objects to pass to the function:
```{r}
mat <- cbind(c(1, 3, 4), c(5, 4, 3))
vec <- c(4, 3)

getY(mat, vec, 3)
```

In this case the function works because the number of columns of matrix `mat` (`r ncol(mat)`) and the length of `vec` (`r length(vec)`) match.

#### **How can we prevent or identify errors?**

<br>

### **1. sanity checks**

We can adapt the function and use the `print()` function to print off values of interest, for example the dimensions of arguments of concern
```{r}
getY <- function(X.matrix, b.vec, a.scalar) {
    
    # print diagnostics
    print(dim(X.matrix))
    print(length(b.vec))

    # multiply the matrix by the vector using %*% operator
    Xb.prod <- X.matrix %*% b.vec

    # multiply the two resulting objects together to get final y
    y <- Xb.prod * a.scalar
    
    return(y)
}

getY(mat, vec, 3)
```

<br>

### **2. debugging**

When you have an error, one thing you can do is use R’s built-in debugger debug() to find at what point the error occurs.
```{r, error=TRUE}
debug(getY)
getY(X.matrix = mat, b.vec = c(2, 3, 6, 4, 1), a.scalar = 9)
```

<br>

## **3. stopping and error messages**

To ensure functions run smoothly you can use functions `stop()` or `stopifnot()` to hault the execution of functions should specific conditions not be met and flag with an appropriate and informative error

#### **`stop()`**

stops execution and returns error message. Usually used with conditional statements
```{r, error=T}
f1 <- function(x) {
    if(!is.numeric(x)){stop("x is not numeric")}else{
        return(2*x)
    }
}
f1(10)
f1("a")
```

#### **`stopifnot()`**
tests the conditional statements supplied as arguments and stops execution if any return `FALSE`
```{r, error=T}
f1 <- function(x) {
    stopifnot(is.numeric(x))
    return(2*x)
}
f1(10)
f1("a")

```

<br>

## Testing

Each function should be easy to test, then you can “freeze” it. Write test cases, which can be automatically checked.

## Tips & tricks

- **Keep your functions short.** Remember you can use them to call other functions!
    - code cleaner and easily testable.
    - code easy to update
- **Document** what the inputs to the function are, what the function does, and what the output is.
- **Check for errors** along the way
- Try out your function with **simple examples** to make sure it’s working properly
- **Use debugging and error messages**, as well as sanity checks as you build your function.
- Avoid mixing computation and plotting in the same
function
eg. 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
res <- some.computation(par1, par2, par3) 
plot(res)
```

- it can be useful to look at the code of a function. Type the function name without the `( )`
    - Will work on any function apart from base functions which are written in C
```{r}
std.dev
```
